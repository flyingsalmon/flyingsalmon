- 👋 Hi, I’m @flyingsalmon (Tony Rahman)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding esp. Python, C, Javascript, HTML etc. and sometimes other proprietary and open-source languages. In addition to tinkering with advanced Excel features for analytics and statistics.
- 🌱 I’m always tweaking with coding of various languages including the above-mentioned and creating solutions, games, automation, and gadgets (like programming microcontrollers). 
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything ATM.
- 📫 How to reach me: http://flyingsalmon.net
